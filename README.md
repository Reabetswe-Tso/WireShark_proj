# Wireshark Project

This project involves network traffic analysis using **Wireshark**.  
The goal was to capture, inspect, and analyze network packets in order to understand network behavior, detect anomalies, and identify potential security issues.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark.
- Analyzed the `.pcapng` file to identify key network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.).
- Investigated packet flow, latency, and possible security risks.
- Documented findings for learning and reporting purposes.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: For capturing and analyzing packets.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project sharing.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download the `.pcapng` file from this repo.
2. Open it in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
3. Explore the captured packets and apply filters such as:
   - `http` â†’ show HTTP traffic
   - `tcp` â†’ show TCP traffic
   - `ip.addr == 192.168.x.x` â†’ filter by IP

## ðŸ“– Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in packet analysis.
- Learned to apply filters to narrow down packet types.
- Understood how to trace communication between client and server.
